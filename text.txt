winter IS the COLDEST season OF the YEAR in POLAR and TEMPERATE climates. It occurs after autumn and before spring.
Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. In many regions, winter brings snow and freezing temperatures.
They differ due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit.
